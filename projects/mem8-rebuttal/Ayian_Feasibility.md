# Ayian: Feasibility Analysis and Implementation Plan

This document assesses the viability of Ayian as a work-backed, persona-bound cryptocurrency inside the MEM|8 ecosystem【113†source】.

## Highlights
- **Proof-of-Contribution (PoC):** Rewards participants for verifiable contributions rather than capital or raw computation.
- **Ethereum L2 foundation:** Ensures scalability, low cost, and inherits Ethereum’s security.
- **Persona-Bound Architecture:** ERC-721 Persona NFTs + ERC-6551 Token Bound Accounts + ERC-20 Ayian rewards.
- **Tokenomics:** Controlled inflationary supply, fair allocation (50% community rewards), DAO governance.
- **Regulatory Strategy:** Emphasizes utility, progressive decentralization, and alignment with emerging “Safe Harbor” frameworks.

The Ayian model connects MEM|8’s wave-based substrate to a self-sustaining economic framework, creating value loops where contributions generate currency, and currency fuels further contributions.
