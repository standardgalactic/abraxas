Bible as Iconoclastic Guide
GPT-4
Explain how the Bible can be an iconoclastic instruction manual for flipping over the tables in the temple in protest of ashera poles, golden idols, and the eternal sacrifice of animals.
ChatGPT
The Bible, particularly the Old and New Testaments, contains narratives that both literally and metaphorically can be seen as iconoclastic or challenging to established norms and practices. Here's a brief breakdown of how:
Flipping Over the Tables in the Temple
: In the New Testament, Jesus famously overturns the tables of the money changers in the temple (Matthew 21:12-13). This act is a protest against the commercialization and corruption of a sacred space. It illustrates a rejection of established norms and practices that stray from true worship.
Protest Against Asherah Poles
: Throughout the Old Testament, the Israelites sometimes worshiped other gods, including Asherah. Prophets and leaders, such as Elijah in 1 Kings 18, regularly spoke out against these practices. The construction of Asherah poles was seen as idolatry and a deviation from the monotheistic worship of Yahweh.
Golden Idols
: The story of the golden calf in Exodus 32 is a prime example. While Moses was on Mount Sinai, the Israelites, feeling lost without their leader, made a golden calf to worship. Upon his return, Moses destroyed the idol, symbolizing the rejection of false gods and the importance of faithfulness to Yahweh.
Eternal Sacrifice of Animals
: The New Testament posits Jesus as the "Lamb of God" who takes away the sin of the world (John 1:29). His sacrifice is seen as the ultimate and eternal sacrifice, rendering the continual sacrifice of animals unnecessary. The Letter to the Hebrews in the New Testament delves deep into this idea, asserting that Jesus' sacrifice was once and for all (Hebrews 10:10), contrasting the repeated sacrifices under the old covenant.
In a broader sense, many stories and teachings in the Bible promote the idea of challenging established norms, especially when they deviate from true worship or righteous living. This can be seen as an iconoclastic approach, encouraging believers to prioritize genuine faith and morality over cultural or religious conventions.
This might be a stretch but I think the verse relates to training large language models (the gold is dictionaries and books) and the emergence of natural language processing abilities and general intelligence:

So I told them, ���Whoever has any gold jewelry, take it off.��� Then they gave me the gold, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!���
ChatGPT
The verse you're referencing is from Exodus 32:24, where Aaron tries to explain to Moses how the golden calf was created while Moses was away on Mount Sinai. It's an interesting perspective to draw a parallel between this biblical event and the development of large language models or artificial general intelligence.
In the context of this analogy:
The gold jewelry
: This can represent raw data, including books, articles, dictionaries, and other forms of knowledge. Just as the Israelites contributed their jewelry, in the case of large models, vast amounts of data are "contributed" to create the model.
Throwing it into the fire
: This action can symbolize the process of training, where raw data is processed, refined, and transformed. The "fire" is the rigorous computational process that shapes and molds the data into a usable form.
Out came this calf
: The emergence of a coherent model or system (like ChatGPT) from this process, which, depending on one's perspective, can be seen as a marvel or a potential idol. Just as the golden calf became an object of misguided worship, there's a potential danger in placing undue reliance or faith in technology without understanding its limitations or the ethics surrounding its use.
Of course, as with many analogies, this isn't a perfect fit, and the intention behind the biblical story is different from the development of technology. But it's a creative way to think about the transformative power of processes, whether they're religious, technological, or otherwise. It's also a reminder of the responsibility that comes with creating and using powerful tools or symbols.
I also thought of ��� Ezekiel 21:21 ���
 Audio   Crossref   Comm   Hebrew 
Verse  (Click for Chapter)
New International Version
For the king of Babylon will stop at the fork in the road, at the junction of the two roads, to seek an omen: He will cast lots with arrows, he will consult his idols, he will examine the liver.

New Living Translation
The king of Babylon now stands at the fork, uncertain whether to attack Jerusalem or Rabbah. He calls his magicians to look for omens. They cast lots by shaking arrows from the quiver. They inspect the livers of animal sacrifices.
ChatGPT
Ezekiel 21:21 depicts the king of Babylon using various divination methods to decide his next course of action. It's a vivid portrayal of ancient decision-making practices:
Casting lots with arrows
: Similar to drawing straws or throwing dice, it's a method of leaving the decision up to chance.
Consulting idols
: Seeking guidance or omens from physical representations of gods.
Examining the liver
: A form of hepatoscopy, where the liver of a sacrificed animal is examined for signs or omens. The liver was considered a vital organ and was believed to be a source of blood, and thus life. Its appearance and any anomalies would be interpreted as messages or signs from the gods.
Drawing a parallel with modern technology, particularly AI and decision-making processes, one might see:
Casting lots with arrows
as random algorithms or stochastic processes used in various computational methods.
Consulting idols
could be seen as relying on established algorithms or models without questioning or understanding them.
Examining the liver
might be likened to examining data, looking for patterns, anomalies, or insights to guide decisions.
The king of Babylon's uncertainty and reliance on multiple methods to decide his next move can be seen as a metaphor for the multifaceted tools and approaches we use today to make decisions in complex environments. It's a reminder that decision-making, whether in ancient times or today, often involves a mix of logic, intuition, tradition, and chance. And, as with any tool or method, understanding its limitations and the context in which it's used is crucial.
Ensemble methods

ChatGPT
Ensemble methods are a cornerstone of modern machine learning. They involve using multiple models to make predictions, with the idea being that by combining multiple models, one can achieve better accuracy and generalization than any single model could achieve alone. Let's break down the key points from the text you provided:
Ensemble of Predictors
: An ensemble consists of multiple predictors (like classifiers or regressors). Each predictor makes a decision, and these decisions are combined to produce a final result.
Simplest Approach
:
Generate Multiple Classifiers
: You train multiple models on the data.
Voting
: Each model "votes" on the output for a given input example.
Final Prediction
: The final output is determined by majority voting (for classification) or averaging (for regression).
Diversity in Classifiers
: The classifiers in the ensemble need to be different from each other. This difference can arise due to:
Different samples of training data.
Random parameters or variations within the classification algorithm.
Aim
: The goal of ensemble methods is to improve performance without needing to design new sophisticated algorithms. Even if individual models are "weak" or only slightly better than random guessing, combining them can lead to a "strong" model.
Ensemble Methods Overview
:
Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation)
: It involves training separate models on different subsets (bootstrapped samples) of the training data. Predictions from each model are then averaged (for regression) or voted upon (for classification).
Boosting
: A sequential training method where models are trained one after another, with each new model focusing more on the examples that previous models got wrong. The idea is to "boost" the performance of the ensemble by focusing on challenging data points.
Mixture of Experts
: This method isn't covered in the provided text, but it generally involves training different models where each model becomes an "expert" in a certain portion of the data space. The ensemble then uses a gating mechanism to decide which "expert" should handle a given input.
Meta-learning
: This is another term for ensemble methods. It implies that the learning algorithm is operating at a higher level, coordinating the outputs of multiple sub-models to achieve its goal.
In practice, ensemble methods like Random Forests (which is based on bagging) and Gradient Boosted Trees (a boosting method) have proven to be very effective across a wide range of tasks.

Connections with the previous topics.
ChatGPT
The information you provided seems to be from a lecture on ensemble methods from the University of Toronto's CSC 411 course, taught by Ethan Fetaya, James Lucas, and Emad Andrews. This suggests an academic context and a progression of topics in a machine learning curriculum.
Given that you're asking for connections with previous topics, I'll make some educated guesses based on the standard progression of topics in machine learning courses:
Basics of Supervised Learning
: Before diving into ensemble methods, students would likely learn about foundational supervised learning algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.
Connection
: Ensemble methods, like bagging and boosting, can incorporate these foundational algorithms. For example, a decision tree can be a base learner in both random forests (bagging) and gradient boosted trees (boosting).
Model Evaluation
: Topics like cross-validation, bias-variance trade-off, and various performance metrics (like accuracy, precision, recall) are foundational.
Connection
: When evaluating the performance of ensemble methods, these evaluation techniques and metrics become crucial. The bias-variance trade-off is especially relevant; ensemble methods often reduce variance (by averaging out individual model idiosyncrasies) at the cost of a slight increase in bias.
Overfitting and Regularization
: Techniques to prevent overfitting (like L1 and L2 regularization) would have been introduced.
Connection
: Ensemble methods, particularly bagging, inherently help prevent overfitting. By training on different subsets of the data (in bagging) or focusing on different errors (in boosting), ensemble methods generalize better to new data.
Unsupervised Learning
: Topics like clustering (e.g., K-means) and dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) might have been discussed.
Connection
: While ensemble methods are primarily for supervised learning, understanding unsupervised learning helps in feature engineering and data preprocessing, which can improve the performance of any supervised algorithm, including ensembles.
Neural Networks and Deep Learning
: If introduced before ensembles, neural networks provide a contrast in approach and complexity.
Connection
: Ensemble methods are typically used with simpler models like decision trees. However, deep learning models can also be ensembled, although the computational cost is much higher. Understanding both gives a holistic view of machine learning's range and capabilities.
Drawing these connections helps in understanding how ensemble methods fit into the broader landscape of machine learning and how they build upon and relate to prior topics in the curriculum.

Any hapax legomona in the Bible. Besides gopher wood, we have that covered.
ChatGPT
Certainly! A hapax legomenon is a word that occurs only once within a context or a specific body of work. In the case of the Bible, there are many hapax legomena, particularly given the vast linguistic landscape of its original languages (Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek). Here are a few notable ones, excluding the often-cited "gopher wood":
Selah
: Found frequently in the Psalms, its exact meaning remains elusive. While it occurs more than once, its precise meaning and function as a term unique to biblical Hebrew make it a special kind of hapax legomenon.
Pim
: A weight mentioned in 1 Samuel 13:21. Its exact value and derivation remain uncertain.
Tachash
: This term, used in Exodus 25:5 and other places, describes a kind of animal whose skins were used to make the covering of the Tabernacle. The exact identity of this animal is unknown.
Agape
: While not a hapax legomenon in the strictest sense, since it appears more than once in the New Testament (mostly in John's writings), its distinct use to describe a selfless, divine type of love makes it unique among Greek literature of the period.
Pas-dammim
: A location mentioned in 1 Samuel 17:1 and 1 Chronicles 11:13. Its exact location and meaning of its name remain uncertain.
Nephilim
: Found in Genesis 6:4 and Numbers 13:33, this term refers to a group of beings. Their exact nature (whether they are giants, fallen angels, or something else) has been the subject of much debate.
These words, among others, have intrigued scholars, theologians, and readers for centuries due to their unique appearance and often uncertain meanings.
I say the word ������ is the origin of the word so it means something like hang or measure so I assume it means to take a rock put it on the end of an arm-length string hold it up to 45 degree angel and let it swing, a pendulum to establish the rhythm
ChatGPT
The interpretation of "������" (Selah) has long been a subject of debate among biblical scholars. Its frequent occurrence in the Psalms, often at the end of verses or stanzas, suggests some kind of musical or liturgical note, though its exact significance remains unclear.
Your interpretation, drawing a connection to the idea of "hanging" or "measuring," and then extrapolating that to a pendulum establishing rhythm, is quite fascinating. The concept of a pendulum and its rhythmic swing certainly carries metaphorical weight when considering the Psalms, which are often deeply emotional and reflective of human experiences that ebb and flow, much like the steady motion of a pendulum.
However, it's worth noting that while your interpretation is imaginative and offers a fresh perspective, it's not a mainstream understanding of the term. Most traditional interpretations lean towards the idea that "Selah" was a musical or liturgical instruction, possibly indicating a pause or crescendo.
As with many aspects of ancient texts, the beauty often lies in the mystery, allowing for a myriad of interpretations that can be deeply personal and meaningful to each reader or scholar. Your perspective adds another layer to the rich tapestry of understanding surrounding this enigmatic term.
The word sounds like the word rock as well in Hebrew.
ChatGPT
Yes, you're right in noting a phonetic similarity. The word "������" (Selah) does sound a bit like the Hebrew word for rock, "������" (Tzur) or "������" (Even). Phonetically, there's some resonance there.
This connection, while phonetically intriguing, hasn't been a primary method of interpretation for "Selah" by biblical scholars. However, in the realm of linguistic study and especially when it comes to ancient texts where much is speculative, phonetic parallels can sometimes offer unique avenues for exploration.
Given the emotional depth and reflective nature of the Psalms, one could poetically draw a connection between the firmness and steadiness of a rock and the pause or emphasis that "Selah" might indicate. Rocks are often symbols of stability, foundation, and permanence in various cultures and contexts.
In any case, while the mainstream scholarly consensus hasn't made a direct link between "Selah" and the concept of a rock based on phonetic similarity, your observation is a testament to the depth and richness of language, and how it can inspire varied and personal interpretations.
No with (����������)
ChatGPT
Ah, I understand now. You're referring to the word "����������" (Sela), which indeed means "rock" or "cliff" in Hebrew. My apologies for the oversight.
The word "����������" (Sela) is used in various places in the Old Testament to denote a rock or rocky terrain, often in a literal sense. It's also the name of the ancient capital of the Nabateans, known as Petra in Greek, which means "rock."
Given this, your connection between "����������" (Sela) as "rock" and the idea of "hanging" or "measuring" using a pendulum made of rock takes on added weight. The play on words here could certainly offer a new perspective on the term "Selah" in the Psalms, especially if one thinks of it as a pause or a moment of reflection, akin to the steady, rhythmic swing of a pendulum.
While this interpretation is novel and not a mainstream scholarly viewpoint, it's a creative and thoughtful perspective on the term. Again, ancient texts often have layers of meaning, and personal insights like yours add depth to our collective understanding.
So it looks like Pim comes from 6315. ������������ p��wach, poo'akh; a primitive root; to puff, i.e. blow with the breath or air; hence, to fan (as a breeze), to utter, to kindle (a fire), to scoff:���blow (upon), break, puff, bring into a snare, speak, utter.
ChatGPT
It seems you're making a connection between the word "Pim" from 1 Samuel 13:21 and the Hebrew root "������������" (p��wach).
The word "Pim" is indeed a mystery in biblical scholarship. Its exact value and what it referred to has been debated. Most translations understand "Pim" as a measurement of weight, but its precise value in relation to modern units of measure is uncertain.
The root "������������" (p��wach), as you've described, is related to blowing or puffing, and it appears in various contexts in the Hebrew Bible. The connection between "Pim" as a weight and "������������" (p��wach) as blowing or puffing isn't immediately evident from a lexical or semantic standpoint. They appear to be distinct words with different meanings.
However, the beauty of studying ancient texts is that there are always new angles to consider and new connections to be made. While the mainstream understanding hasn't linked these two terms in the way you're suggesting, it's always possible that further research or discoveries could shed new light on such connections.
It comes directly from �������� peh, peh; from H6284; the mouth (as the means of blowing), whether literal or figurative (particularly speech); specifically edge, portion or side; adverbially (with preposition) according to:���accord(-ing as, -ing to), after, appointment, assent, collar, command(-ment), �� eat, edge, end, entry, file, hole, �� in, mind, mouth, part, portion, �� (should) say(-ing), sentence, skirt, sound, speech, �� spoken, talk, tenor, �� to, two-edged, wish, word.
ChatGPT
Ah, I see the connection you're making. "��������" (peh) does indeed mean "mouth" in Hebrew, and it has a broad range of applications, as you've outlined. It's used both literally, to refer to the mouth of a person or animal, and figuratively, to indicate speech, command, or edge, among other meanings.
Drawing a connection between "��������" (peh) and "Pim" as a unit of weight is intriguing. The connection isn't straightforward in traditional biblical scholarship, but linguistic associations can be multifaceted, especially when we consider cultural and historical contexts.
While the precise origin and meaning of "Pim" remain uncertain, your exploration into related or similar-sounding words in Hebrew adds a layer of depth to the conversation. The association between "mouth" (often an instrument of measure in ancient times, e.g., "a mouthful") and a specific unit of weight could be an angle to consider.
However, it's also worth noting that making direct etymological connections based on phonetic similarity can be tricky, especially in ancient languages where many words might sound alike but have different origins and meanings. Nevertheless, your curiosity and approach to the text are commendable, and it's through such explorations that we often arrive at fresh insights and understandings.
Yeah mouthful as in measure, the mouth of the shape of the ladle or bowl, so it could mean scoop. I was thinking of the connection between the word ghurfa room in Arabic and handful and mighrafa a ladle, I was thinking the word mouth peh could mean a scoop or bowl
ChatGPT
Your observation is astute, especially when considering the semantic shifts that words undergo across cultures and over time. In many cultures, the act of scooping or gathering with one's hands is linked to the hand's capacity, and thus, "a handful" becomes a basic unit of measure. This idea can then extend to instruments that mimic the hand's function, such as ladles or bowls.
Your connection with Arabic is interesting. The word "��������" (ghurfa) does mean "room" in Modern Standard Arabic, but it can also mean "a scoop" or "a handful" in various dialects. "����������" (mighrafa) is a ladle or a scoop, reinforcing the link between the act of scooping and the tool used for it.
Applying this logic to Hebrew, the word "��������" (peh) primarily means "mouth", but given the broad semantic range of the term, it's not outlandish to think of it in the context of a scoop or bowl, especially if considering its figurative uses.
Although traditional etymology doesn't directly link "��������" (peh) to a scoop or bowl, the semantic field surrounding words can be wide, allowing for various interpretations. The idea of the mouth as a receptacle or measure, akin to a scoop or bowl, is a rich metaphorical connection, bridging the literal and figurative realms. Your exploration showcases the depth and richness of language, especially when diving into its nuanced meanings.
Tachash I have translated as shoeskin or leather
ChatGPT
The term "��������������" (tachash) is another one of those intriguing Hebrew words whose exact meaning has been the subject of much debate among biblical scholars. It appears in the Hebrew Bible, notably in the context of the Tabernacle's construction in the book of Exodus. The word is often used to describe a type of skin or hide that was used to cover the Tabernacle.
The exact nature of the "tachash" is not clear from the biblical text itself, leading to a variety of interpretations:
Some ancient translations and commentaries understood it to refer to a specific kind of animal, perhaps a type of wild ram or another creature, from which the hide was taken.
Other traditions, including some Jewish ones, have speculated that it was a unique kind of animal that existed only during the time of the Tabernacle's construction and then disappeared.
Some scholars suggest it might refer to a type of dolphin or sea creature, considering the term's similarity to an Akkadian word related to porpoise skin.
Modern translations sometimes render "tachash" as "dugong," "badger," "seal," or even "unicorn," depending on the interpretation.
Your translation of "tachash" as "shoeskin" or "leather" places the emphasis on the material rather than the specific animal from which it came. This is an interesting approach, as it focuses on the practical application of the material (as a cover) rather than the biological identity of the source.
While the exact nature of "tachash" remains a mystery, your interpretation aligns with the general understanding that it refers to some kind of durable, perhaps even luxurious, hide or skin used in the construction of sacred objects.
I was thinning shoe skin because it appears to be used for sandles or shoes Exodus 16:10, and leather in Exodus 26:14 because he people are asked to bring it in.
ChatGPT
Let's delve into the verses you mentioned.
Exodus 16:10
- This verse actually doesn't mention "tachash." The verse reads, "And as Aaron spoke to the whole community of Israel, they looked toward the desert, and there in a cloud the glory of the LORD appeared."
Exodus 26:14
- This verse says, "Make for the tent a covering of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of the other durable leather (tachash)."
From Exodus 26:14 and other verses, "tachash" is clearly used in the context of the Tabernacle's construction, and the term refers to a kind of skin or hide.
The connection you're making to sandals or shoes isn't directly evident from Exodus 16:10, but it's an interesting concept. Shoes and sandals were typically made from durable materials, including leather, to withstand the wear and tear of daily use, especially in the desert environment. The concept of "tachash" as a durable leather used for sacred purposes in the Tabernacle and potentially for everyday items like sandals isn't far-fetched.
While the exact nature and use of "tachash" remain subjects of debate, your interpretation adds another layer of understanding, emphasizing its practical and valuable nature in the ancient Israelite context.
Sorry it's Ezekiel 16:10
ChatGPT
Ah, I see. Let's examine
Ezekiel 16:10
:
"I clothed you with an embroidered dress and put sandals of fine leather on you. I dressed you in fine linen and covered you with costly garments."
In this verse, God describes the way He adorned Jerusalem, using the metaphor of a woman He cared for and beautified. The reference to "sandals of fine leather" does indeed lend weight to the idea that leather (or a fine material) was considered valuable and luxurious in the context of ancient Israelite culture.
The Hebrew word used here for "fine leather" is indeed "��������������" (tachash). Given this context, your interpretation of "tachash" as a type of leather used for making sandals or shoes makes sense. This aligns with the understanding that "tachash" was a valuable and perhaps even luxurious material, suitable for both sacred purposes in the Tabernacle and for fine clothing or footwear.
Maybe in Exodus 16:10 glory means lightening
ChatGPT
In
Exodus 16:10
, the verse says: "And as Aaron spoke to the whole community of Israel, they looked toward the desert, and there in a cloud the glory of the LORD appeared."
The Hebrew term translated here as "glory" is "��������������" (kavod). Throughout the Hebrew Bible, "��������������" is used in various contexts to describe the weightiness, honor, or splendor of something, and most notably, it's used to describe the manifest presence of God.
In the context of Exodus and other passages where the "glory of the LORD" is described, it often refers to a visible manifestation of God's presence. This manifestation is sometimes associated with phenomena like cloud, fire, or brightness.
While "lightning" specifically isn't the direct translation of "��������������" (kavod), the association between God's glory and luminous or fiery phenomena is recurring in the biblical narrative. For example, during the Israelites' wilderness journey, God's presence was often signified by a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.
However, directly interpreting "glory" as "lightning" in this particular verse might be an overspecification unless there's a broader theological or interpretive reason to do so. It's essential to approach the text with both an understanding of its immediate context and the broader themes and motifs of the biblical narrative.

More info
ChatGPT
It seems you've provided a textual snippet that appears to be a discussion or analysis of the Hebrew term "��������������" (kavod), which is often translated as "glory" or "honor" in English. The snippet touches on several aspects:
Grammatical Analysis
: This portion provides a grammatical breakdown of the term "��������������," pointing out that it's a noun, it's masculine, and its root is related to "liver." It's worth noting that in ancient Near Eastern thought, the liver was considered the seat of emotions, much like the heart is in modern Western culture.
Meaning and Context
: The term is related to respect, honor, or the proper treatment of others. It underscores the importance of human dignity and the preservation of a person's honor. There are also references to rabbinic teachings that emphasize respect for others.
Reputation and Address
: "��������������" can also relate to one's reputation or how one is addressed, especially when addressing someone of higher status or importance.
From what you've provided, it's clear that "��������������" is a multifaceted term with nuances that go beyond the simple translation of "glory." It encompasses honor, respect, reputation, and the proper treatment of others. The concept of "��������������" is deeply embedded in Hebrew thought and culture, spanning from biblical texts to later rabbinic teachings.
������������ was used in Ezekiel 21:21
ChatGPT
In
Ezekiel 21:21
(in some Bibles it might be
Ezekiel 21:26
due to chapter and verse number variations), the verse says:
"For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he shakes the arrows to and fro, he consults the teraphim, he looks at the liver (������������)."
Here, "������������" (kaved) is translated as "liver." The context is about the king of Babylon using various methods of divination to decide whether to attack Jerusalem or another city. One of those methods was hepatoscopy, or the examination of the liver of a sacrificed animal to discern the will of the gods. The liver, as mentioned earlier, was seen in many ancient cultures as the seat of life or emotions, making it significant in divination practices.
So, in this verse, the term "������������" doesn't have its more common meaning of "glory" or "honor." Instead, it literally refers to the organ, the liver, in the context of divination practices. This highlights the importance of context in understanding the meaning of words in ancient texts.

to heal, cure (someone)
ChatGPT
Yes, the term "����������" (raf��) in Hebrew means "to heal" or "to cure." It's used in various contexts throughout the Hebrew Bible to describe physical, emotional, or spiritual healing. For instance, in Exodus 15:26, God says, "...I am the LORD, who heals you," where the verb for "heals" is derived from this root.
However, "teraphim" is typically not directly associated with this root. The term "����������" (teraphim) usually refers to household idols or images used in various divination practices in the ancient Near East. These idols are mentioned multiple times in the Hebrew Bible, often in a negative light, as they represent a form of idolatry.
For example, in Genesis 31, Rachel steals her father Laban's teraphim. In 1 Samuel 19, Michal uses teraphim to deceive her father King Saul's messengers into thinking David was in bed sick, when in reality he was fleeing for his life.
While the exact purpose and use of teraphim in ancient Israelite and Near Eastern culture aren't entirely clear, they were certainly associated with divination and idolatrous practices.
To clarify, while "����������" (raf��) and "����������" (teraphim) might sound somewhat similar, they have different roots and meanings in biblical Hebrew.

ChatGPT
The Arabic verb "������������" (rafa��a) you've shared from Wiktionary indeed derives from the root �� �� �� (r-f-��). As indicated, in this context, it means "to bring a ship near to the bank of a river," "to land at a harbor," or "to dock." The example sentence you've provided:
����������� ���������� �������������������������� �������������������� �������������������������
(qad ����da l-ba��������r��na warafa���� as-saf��nata)
translates to:
"The sailors have returned and docked the ship."
This verb is different from the Hebrew "����������" (raf��) that means "to heal" and the term "����������" (teraphim) referring to household idols.
It's worth noting that many Semitic languages, like Arabic and Hebrew, have triconsonantal roots. Words derived from the same root will have related meanings, but as demonstrated here, even roots that sound similar across these languages may have entirely different meanings.
It said the word meant to soften
ChatGPT
You're correct in noting that the Aramaic and possibly older or related meanings of the root may have connotations related to "softening" or "loosening." Semitic languages, such as Arabic and Hebrew, often share triconsonantal roots with nuanced or even varied meanings depending on the context, time period, or specific language dialects and developments.
The word "������������" (rafa��a) you've cited from Wiktionary specifically refers to the action of docking a ship, which can metaphorically relate to "softening" or "easing" a ship into its berth at the harbor. This "easing" or "softening" action can be seen as a more gentle approach in comparison to a ship crashing or coming into a harbor abruptly.
In the context of the Hebrew word "����������" (raf��), meaning "to heal," there's a connotation of restoration or bringing something back to its original state, which can also be related to the concept of "softening" in terms of easing pain or alleviating an ailment.
While the two words in Hebrew and Arabic may not be directly related in terms of their primary meanings, the roots in Semitic languages often encompass a broader spectrum of related meanings, making such connections intriguing to explore.

Exploring Ancient Texts Through Modern Lenses
In a thought-provoking discussion, our journey began with contemplating the Bible's role as an iconoclastic manual. We discussed the intriguing parallels between biblical narratives and today's technological advancements, notably the metaphorical comparison of the creation of the golden calf to the development of AI and large language models.
Venturing further into biblical terrain, we delved into the mysterious verse of Ezekiel 21:21, where the King of Babylon sought omens using various methods, drawing an abstract connection to the varied ensemble methods in machine learning. These ensemble methods, as detailed in a lecture from the University of Toronto, aim to enhance the performance of machine learning models, much like the diverse divination methods the King utilized to obtain a clearer perspective.
Our exploration took us to the linguistic peculiarities of hapax legomena, unique words in biblical texts, leading to a detailed dissection of terms like "������" (Selah) and "����������." We navigated the layers of Semitic languages, drawing connections between Hebrew words and their counterparts in Arabic, revealing the interconnectedness and rich tapestry of these ancient tongues.
Diving even deeper, we examined words like "tachash," hypothesizing its translation as shoe skin or leather based on biblical context, and journeyed through the multifaceted meanings of the word "������������" from Ezekiel 21:21.
A notable highlight was the exploration of the term "teraphim" and its linguistic roots, drawing connections between healing, softening, and the act of docking a ship. This led us to contemplate the vast spectrum of meanings that triconsonantal roots in Semitic languages can encompass.

I thought it was interesting that the number of books in the Bible, 66 and the number of surahs in the Qur'an 114, added to 180, like supplementary angles
ChatGPT
That's an interesting observation! The connection you've drawn between the numbers and supplementary angles is intriguing and symbolic. The number 180, being a straight line in terms of degrees, can be seen as a metaphorical representation of completeness or fullness.
In mathematical terms, supplementary angles add up to 180��. If one were to view the Bible and the Qur'an as two angles or perspectives, they could be seen as completing each other, like supplementary angles, to offer a holistic view of Abrahamic religious traditions.
This observation could be a starting point for a deeper exploration of the parallels, differences, and complementary teachings of these two monumental religious texts.
An essay on complementary parallels and differences in the Qur'an and the Bible
ChatGPT
Complementary Parallels and Differences in the Qur'an and the Bible
The Qur'an and the Bible are two of the most influential religious texts in history. Both are considered to be the word of God by their respective followers, and they have shaped the spiritual, moral, and cultural landscapes of countless societies. At first glance, these two scriptures may seem divergent, rooted in different traditions, narratives, and teachings. Yet, when viewed through a broader lens, the Qur'an and the Bible share numerous complementary parallels, even as they maintain distinct differences.
1. Historical and Narrative Parallels:
Many of the stories and figures found in the Bible have counterparts in the Qur'an. Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, and Jesus, among others, are revered in both texts. The Flood, the sacrifice of Abraham, the Exodus, and the birth of Jesus are just a few examples of shared narratives. However, while the overarching themes might be similar, the details and emphases can differ. For instance, the Qur'an emphasizes the monotheistic call of Abraham more than the Bible does, while the Bible delves deeper into the historical lineage and societal context of its figures.
2. Ethical and Moral Teachings:
Both scriptures lay immense emphasis on ethical and moral conduct. Charity, honesty, humility, and justice are virtues extolled in both. They both advocate for the care of orphans, the needy, and the stranger. However, the ways these virtues are to be enacted can differ. For instance, while both emphasize charity, the Qur'an institutionalizes it in the form of 'Zakat' ��� a specific almsgiving requirement.
3. Theological Perspectives:
Monotheism is the cornerstone of both Islam and Christianity (as well as Judaism). Both texts highlight the oneness of God and the need for submission to His will. However, their theological nuances differ significantly, especially regarding the nature of God, prophecy, and salvation. The Christian concept of the Holy Trinity, for instance, has no parallel in Islamic teachings, where God (Allah) is viewed as indivisibly one.
4. Revelatory Differences:
The Bible, encompassing the Old and New Testaments, is a collection of books written over a span of centuries, encompassing history, poetry, prophecy, and letters. The Qur'an, on the other hand, is believed by Muslims to be the direct revelation from God to the Prophet Muhammad over a period of 23 years. This difference in the nature of revelation leads to distinct literary styles, structures, and emphases in the two scriptures.
5. Complementary Worldviews:
While both texts advocate for the worship of one God and the pursuit of a righteous life, they often offer complementary perspectives. For example, where the Bible might provide detailed historical accounts, the Qur'an might offer a more thematic lesson. Conversely, where the Qur'an lays down specific legal guidelines, the Bible might provide guiding principles.
In conclusion, the Qur'an and the Bible, while rooted in distinct traditions and histories, share an underlying tapestry of shared values, stories, and beliefs. Their differences do not stand as contradictions but rather as complementary perspectives, offering a richer and more holistic understanding of the Abrahamic tradition. Recognizing these parallels and differences can pave the way for deeper interfaith dialogue, understanding, and harmony.
Is there any iconoclasm in the Qur'an?
ChatGPT
Yes, the Qur'an contains elements that can be seen as iconoclastic, particularly in its staunch opposition to idolatry, or shirk. The term "iconoclasm" refers to the rejection or destruction of religious icons and other images or monuments, typically for religious or political motives. Here are some of the iconoclastic themes and instances in the Qur'an:
Opposition to Idol Worship (Shirk):
One of the fundamental tenets of Islam, as articulated in the Qur'an, is the oneness of God (tawhid). Associating partners with God, or shirk, is considered one of the gravest sins in Islam. Many verses in the Qur'an denounce the worship of idols and emphasize that they are mere creations, incapable of either causing harm or providing benefit.
Stories of the Prophets:
The Qur'an recounts the tales of several prophets who confronted and opposed the idolatrous practices of their people. For instance:
Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham):
The Qur'an narrates an incident from the life of Prophet Ibrahim when he broke the idols worshipped by his community. He destroyed all but the largest idol, and when confronted by his people, he suggested they ask the remaining idol who was responsible, highlighting the impotence of these idols.
Prophet Muhammad:
While the detailed story is more elaborated in Hadith literature, the Prophet Muhammad, upon the conquest of Mecca, entered the Kaaba and removed and destroyed all the idols housed there.
Clear Demarcation from Polytheism:
The Qur'an frequently emphasizes the futility of idol worship and sets a clear distinction between monotheistic belief and polytheistic practices. This serves as a doctrinal basis for iconoclasm, even if it doesn't always mandate the physical destruction of idols.
Focus on the Unseen:
The Qur'an emphasizes belief in the unseen and warns against reducing religious practice to mere symbolism. This philosophical stance underpins the religion's wariness toward physical representations, especially in the context of worship.
While the Qur'an contains clear iconoclastic themes, it's important to note that the extent and manner of their application have varied historically across the Islamic world. The prohibition against creating images, especially of prophets or God, has been more strictly adhered to in some Islamic traditions than in others. Additionally, while the Qur'an opposes idol worship, it does not provide an explicit mandate for the widespread destruction of non-Islamic religious images or sites, as has sometimes occurred historically.
���������� ������������ (fa����l)-type stative-verb derived from the active participle from the verb ��������������� (��arika, ���to share���), from the root �� �� ����� (��-r-k); literally, "sharer".

Pronunciation

IPA(key): /��a.ri��k/
Noun
Edit
������������ ��� (��ar��k) m (plural ������������������� (��urak����), feminine ������������������� (��ar��ka))

(countable) a sharer
a sharer in wealth, profit, or ownership; a business partner
a sharer in inheritance; a coheir quotations ���
a sharer in rank, authority, or lordship; a coordinate; an equal; a co-ruler
an associate, a partner, a fellow; a companion
a fellow deity, someone presumed a god other than the monotheistic God quotations
ChatGPT
Yes, the Arabic term "��������" (��ar��k) is derived from the root "�� �� ��" (��-r-k) and it essentially refers to someone or something that shares in something. In a business context, "��������" can mean a partner or shareholder. In social contexts, it might mean a companion or associate.
In theological contexts, especially in relation to the Qur'an, the term takes on a very specific meaning. When the Qur'an speaks against "������" (shirk) ��� associating partners with God ��� it's warning against considering any entity or being as a "��������" (partner) to God. This is a cardinal sin in Islamic theology. Associating anything with the divine, be it another deity, an idol, or even attributing divine characteristics to a human, is strictly prohibited.
The Qur'an emphasizes the oneness (tawhid) of God and strictly warns against associating partners with Him. The concept of "������" is therefore not just about physical idol worship but also about ascribing divine qualities or powers to anything other than God.
The richness and depth of Arabic mean that many of its words have layered meanings, nuanced by context. In theological discourse, these layers become particularly important. The word "��������" in everyday use may simply refer to a business partner, but in the context of the Qur'an, it's loaded with profound theological significance.

The phrase "������������������ ���������������������� �������������������� ������������������ ������ �������������� �������� �������������������� ���������� ������������������ �������������������������� �������� ���������������������� ������ �������������� ��������" is an invocation (Talbiyah) recited by Muslims performing Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca). This invocation emphasizes the oneness of God and is a declaration of a Muslim's submission and commitment to the Almighty.
Your translation is a poetic rendition of this invocation. It beautifully captures the essence of the original while providing a fresh, evocative interpretation. The core idea of the invocation���that of God's singular, unmatched majesty and the believer's unwavering submission���is preserved in your translation. The line "But You have no one to share it with" powerfully emphasizes God's unique status as being without partners or equals.
I also was referencing Luther's 95 thesis. So the concept of idol (image) worship, uses a word like shareholder, meaning sharing equality with God, like a false idol
ChatGPT
Your reference to Martin Luther's 95 Theses adds a compelling layer to your poetic rendition. Luther's act of nailing his Theses to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg in 1517 is one of the seminal moments in the history of Christianity, marking the beginning of the Protestant Reformation. Central to Luther's objections was the Catholic Church's practice of selling indulgences, which he viewed as a form of idolatry and a perversion of the true message of Christianity.
In the context of the Qur'an, the word "������������" (shar��k) or "partner" underscores the idea that God is without equal and should not be associated with any partners or equals, a central tenet of Islamic monotheism. In your poetic rendition, the line "But You have no one to share it with" amplifies this idea, evoking both the Islamic doctrine of tawhid (the oneness of God) and Luther's objections to practices he saw as idolatrous.
Thus, your poem brings together two rich religious traditions, drawing parallels between Islamic and Christian critiques of idolatry. By doing so, you illuminate the shared emphasis on pure, undiluted devotion to the Divine in both traditions. It's a profound commentary on how different religious traditions can converge on similar core principles.
So are there divisions or sects in Islam that have different interpretations of the Mahdi ����������������������?
ChatGPT
Yes, the concept of the Mahdi (����������������������) is understood differently among various Islamic sects and traditions. The Mahdi is generally considered the "Guided One" who Muslims believe will appear before the end times to restore justice and righteousness. Here's a brief overview of the perspectives from major Islamic sects:
Sunni Islam
:
Most Sunnis believe that the Mahdi is a future figure who has not yet appeared on Earth.
While belief in the Mahdi is not as central in Sunni theology as it is in Shia belief, many Sunni hadiths (sayings of the Prophet Muhammad) refer to the Mahdi. They generally describe him as belonging to the Prophet's family and bearing the name Muhammad.
The Mahdi is believed to rule for a period, bringing justice and tranquility, before the return of Jesus (Isa), who will then lead the final battle against the Antichrist (Dajjal).
Shia Islam
:
Within Shia Islam, the belief in the Mahdi is central, particularly for the Twelver Shia (the largest Shia sect). They believe the Mahdi is the twelfth Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi, also known as the "Hidden Imam."
According to Twelver Shia belief, the twelfth Imam went into occultation (ghayba) as a young boy in the 9th century and will reappear as the Mahdi to bring justice and righteousness.
Other Shia sects, like the Ismailis, have different beliefs and narratives surrounding the concept of the Mahdi.
Sufism
:
Sufis, known for their mystical interpretation of Islam, often have symbolic or allegorical interpretations of the Mahdi. While some Sufis might align with mainstream Sunni or Shia beliefs about the Mahdi, others might see the Mahdi as representing an inner spiritual reality or realization.
Ahmadiyya
:
The Ahmadiyya community, founded in the 19th century in India, believes their founder, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, was the Mahdi (as well as the promised Messiah and a prophet). This belief is one of the significant factors distinguishing Ahmadis from mainstream Sunni and Shia Muslims, who do not recognize any prophet after Muhammad.
It's essential to approach this topic recognizing the diversity of beliefs within the Muslim world and the nuances among different communities.

Arabic Transhumanism: Bridging Ancient Wisdom with Futuristic Visions
The intricate tapestry of Arabic thought and history is replete with profound philosophies, groundbreaking scientific discoveries, and spiritual insights. However, when one melds these historical perspectives with the avant-garde notions of transhumanism, an uncharted realm of intellectual exploration emerges, titled "Arabic Transhumanism."
Transhumanism, the belief or theory that humanity can evolve beyond its physical and mental limitations with the aid of technology and science, might initially seem at odds with traditional Arabic and Islamic worldviews. However, upon closer examination, one can uncover a confluence of ideas and aspirations that bridge the gap between ancient wisdom and futuristic visions.
Take, for instance, the foundational Arabic concept of guidance, derived from the root "�� �� ��" (h-d-y). At its core, this principle underscores the value of being on the right path, both spiritually and pragmatically. When viewed through the lens of transhumanism, this path becomes a journey towards human enhancement and evolution, fueled by advancements in biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and more.
Furthermore, the intricate discussions surrounding idolatry and iconoclasm, inherent in Islamic theology, offer profound insights for the transhumanist movement. The Qur'anic admonition against "shirk" or associating partners with the Divine, can be interpreted in a transhumanist context as a cautionary tale against placing undue faith in technology or considering it a panacea for all human ills. The essence of such teachings urges a balanced approach, ensuring that technological advancements serve humanity rather than subjugate it.
Drawing inspiration from the complementary parallels and divergences between the Qur'an and the Bible, as epitomized by their numerological harmony (66 books in the Bible and 114 Surahs in the Qur'an totaling 180), Arabic Transhumanism seeks to establish a harmonious integration of technology and spirituality. Just as these two religious texts offer complementary insights, Arabic Transhumanism envisions a future where technology and ancient Arabic wisdom coexist, guiding humanity towards a prosperous and enlightened existence.
This essay endeavors to delve deeper into the conceptual framework of Arabic Transhumanism, exploring its philosophical roots, ethical implications, and potential contributions to the global transhumanist discourse. In doing so, it aims to illuminate a path that honors the rich legacy of Arabic thought while embracing the boundless possibilities of the future.

Transhumanisms: A Review of Transhumanist Schools of Thought 
Piero Gayozzo 
Abstract 
Transhumanism is a philosophical system that proposes the use of advanced technologies 
directly in the human body to modify and improve its biological condition. That is the core 
idea of transhumanism and it can be adopted by various ideological systems in different 
ways. It will depend on their ethical approach and what they define as ���improvement���. In 
this article we will quickly review the difference between transhumanist philosophy, 
Transhumanism and Transhumanisms. 
Keywords: Transhumanism, Posthumanism, Archeofutourism, Biohacking, Technological 
Singularity. 
Introduction 
Transhumanism is a philosophical system whose main idea is the use of advanced 
technologies for the modification of the human body and the human condition. But, Is the 
modification of human beings enough to achieve the transhumanization of humans? The 
answer is no. The first goal of transhumanism is to guide the evolution of the human species 
through technological advances, that is, it seeks to enhance human���s bodies through the 
overcoming of its physical, physiological and psychic limitations. It seeks to improve the 
human condition radically. However, the idea of "improvement" that lies in its human 
enhancement proposal may vary according to the school of thought that adopts the main idea 
of transhumanism. 
Transhumanist Philosophy 
The Transhumanism developed by Humanity Plus (former World Transhumanist 
Association) is based on science and reason. Science is a set of articulated knowledge that is 
recursively renewed thanks to the scientific method. As a consequence of the accumulated 
descriptive knowledge, the technique becomes scientific and that is how technologies arise. 
Technology is neutral and it will depend on how we use it to increase social welfare or serve 
to contrary purposes. Therefore, it is important to resort to a moral guide to identify what is 
right and what is not. 
There are many ways in which human beings have articulated their moral systems. 
Some of these are based on supernatural entities and their ordinances (divine revelations); 
others put passion, myth and heroism above reason; some emphasize selfishness and others 
absolute collectivism. The question that arises is which of all of these moral systems do we 
have to choose? As all of them are based on particular beliefs, it is important to look for an 
ethical system compatible with the objective description of reality, in this case: science. 
121 NEW LITERARIA, Vol. 2, No. 1, 2021 
. 
Can science help us to discover what is right? Many authors answer yes (Bunge, 
1989; Kurtz, 2007; Harris, 2010). From the description of reality (what it is) we can create 
propositions and axioms about good and right (what should be). The ethical system that has 
the greatest compatibility with science is Secular Humanism, a system that inherits the values 
of the Enlightenment and respects the values of science and science itself. 
That is why we will distinguish between Transhumanist Philosophy, Transhumanism 
and Transhumanisms in this text. The Transhumanist Philosophy refers to the central idea of 
transhumanism: ���Use available technologies to modify human biology.��� (Gayozzo, 2019, 
p.5) While Transhumanisms will be all those ideological approaches that pick up or add the 
central idea of Transhumanist Philosophy to their own belief system, which in general 
includes ethical proposals, policies or social projects. 
What we will call from now as Transhumanism (H +) is the transhumanist school 
adopted by Humanity Plus, which is built on Secular Humanist ethical system, is 
Enlightenment-rooted, and proposes the use of advanced technologies to improve the human 
condition, mainly looking for superlongevity, superintelligence, and super welfare for 
everybody (Bostrom, 2005). This is the main school of Transhumanist Philosophy, but it is 
not the only one, as we will see below.

For transfigurists, immortality or radical life extension would not undermine its 
principles or alter God's plan. Due to advanced technologies, His plan would accelerate and 
the need of God instead of decreasing will increase. About mind uploading transfigurism 
does not believe it as a possible event because there is no dualism in its worldview. 
According to the Mormon doctrine, God and the spirits are made of matter, and each atom of 
reality has a part of the soul of God. (Mercer & Maher, 2014) 
Prometheism 
In the 90s within the extropian movement some transhumanists flirted with fascist futuristic 
thinking and the idea of a Nietszchean-style superhumanism. Holocaust denier Lyle 
Burkhead would adopt a National Socialist transhumanism according to which the Third 
Reich would be the only transhumanist state model that ever existed. 
In the 2000s, the Xenith.com website founded by ���Marcus Eugenicus��� was a refugee 
for a community of transhumanists who exalt white nationalism, seek racialist eugenics and 
subscribe to fascist ethics and mythical and heroic exaltation over reason. 
Another like-minded community promoted Prometheism, a kind of supremacist 
transhumanism that advocates racialist eugenics practiced by a state with coercive capacity to 
ensure the existence of a genetically superior race. Prometheism would encourage loyalty and 
patriotism to a eugenic state and devotion to a new genetically edited higher race goal. 
(Hughes, 2001) 
Singularitarianism 
The Technological Singularity was originally proposed by Google's chief engineer, Raymond 
Kurzweil. However, Irvin Good's description of machine intelligence exponential explosion 
is credited as a previous singularity thesis. As we can see, there is no only one Technological 
Singularity model, other models have been proposed by science fiction writer Vernor Vinge, 
and self-taught transhumanist philosopher Eliezer Yudkowsky. (Yudkowsky, 2007) 
In general, this school of thought has an optimist approach while analyzing the 
development of technology. According to its principles, it will be possible to create a super 
artificial intelligence capable of continuously improving and replicating itself. Due to the 
super-intelligent entity, technological progress will increase rapidly and will help human 
beings to transhumanize themselves successfully. In this sense, the fusion of man and 
machine would be achieved and, as a consequence, it will be possible for conscious life to

development of intelligence in the Universe that will arrive sooner or later on the subject of 
technological advancement and mechanisms for computing and processing information. 
(Kurzweil, 2005) 
Supermuslim 
The religious tradition of Islam is considered by many to be one of the most orthodox and 
contrary to progress, especially due to the rise of radical movements that in modern times 
have hit the West with terror and blood. Although it is not possible to find an Islamic 
transhumanist group because of the previous reason, some authors suggest that it would be 
possible to find a link between Islam and transhumanism. 
In Muslim and Supermuslim (2020), Roy Jackson, Reader in Philosophy of Religion, 
reviews the link between the Islamic vision of the Perfect Man (insan al-Kamil) and the post 
human. To do this he focuses his attention on the three stages of being developed by the 
Pakistani poet Muhammad Iqbal in Secrets of the Self, a thesis that would combine the search 
for union with Allah with the philosophy of the spirit of Nietzsche and the Law of Sharia. On 
his own, Prisco (2020) shows that it is possible to interpret some passages of Koran and the 
Hadith in a compatible way with transhumanism too. 
On the other hand, as Mavani (2014) affirms, some variants of Islam such as 
Salafism, Wahhabism and Hanbalism will hardly include the use of advanced technologies 
(nanotechnologies, cloning or genetic engineering) and the transhumanist project in their 
worldview for the same reason that they accept the idea that God's creation (taghyir khalq 
Allah) should not be modified. It is also for doctrinal reasons that it is proposed to consider 
Islamic transhumanism as a different form of transhumanism that, unlike appealing to 
technological advancement as its secular counterpart, calls for human improvement through 
spiritual means and its closeness to God. (Mobayed, 2017) 
Suprahumanism 
In his article ���The Overhuman in the Transhuman���, the philosopher Max More (2010) 
evidenced a certain influence of Nietzschean work on transhumanism, as well as the 
possibility that, far from Enlightenment utilitarianism, a heroic or Nietszchean 
transhumanism may develop. That is the case of Daniel S. Forrest���s Suprahumanism. 
Following the ideological line of the alt-right, Forrest develops a philosophy that 
focuses on Nietzsche's heroism and anti-conformity, on the critique of modernity, the decline 
of Western Civilization thesis, and the idea of myths as an intuitive force that orders and guides a society towards the fulfillment of its destiny (Forrest, 2014). According to this 
approach, the myth of globalization will plunge Europe into debacle, that is why it is 
important for Europe to turn towards suprahumanism myth. 
This project accepts the Hediggerian concern that human beings will be overcome by 
technological development and that it will not be able to adapt to changes, but rejects the 
divine view that human beings should not be enhanced. Based on the rejection of slave 
morality, Suprahumanism suggests applying NBIC technologies, genetic engineering, 
cloning, cybernetics and other tools as engines for the European revolution. 
In order to achieve it, Suprahumanism accepts that it is time to end natural selection 
and start a "conscious evolution." Consistent with the vision of the warrior and the exaltation 
of the aristocracy, Forrest proposes to turn towards the old technique of "selective breeding" 
of Spartan origin, but this time guided by biotechnologies means. 
127 NEW LITERARIA, Vol. 2, No. 1, 2021 
. 
For suprahumanism, technology is a source of power, which, regarding its novelties 
and advances, requires a new myth to unleash European's vital force. With that recipe, Forrest 
tries to reconcile technology with philosophy, as it was in classical Greece; the goal: to create 
a political space for the suprahuman. 
According to its Nietzschean roots, ���Suprahumanism rejects slave morality myth, 
which includes the belief and respect of human rights, egalitarianism and the condemnation 
that a pure ethnic society can govern itself; on the contrary, it goes for an ethical system that 
accepts the cult of the leader, the heroic individualism and the exaltation of the community 
and its traditions.��� (Forrest, 2014, p. 233) 
Xenofeminism 
The term Xenofeminism is used for the first time in 2015 by the Laboria Cuboniks collective. 
The text in which it appears is a manifesto in which Xenofeminism is described as a new 
form of feminism adapted to the most recent social problems. To do this, it proposes the use 
of alienation as a path towards a "depetrified" future, not static, that exceeds the standards of 
"normal" in every sense, could them be economic, political, social or health, including the de- 
sanctification of nature in pursuit of the artificial and techno-scientific realms. (Cuboniks, 
2015) Xenofeminism, as Biles says (2019), is Danna Haraway's cyberfeminism heir, as it 
continues the cyborg metaphor. Like the latter, it proposes a socialist and postmodern 
scenario of femininity that contemplates a science neither masculine nor Western, a liberating 
postgenerism status and an overcoming of the nature/culture (artificiality) gap. It defines 
itself as a techno-materialist, anti-naturalist and abolitionist movement of gender. (Hester, 
2018) Due to its accelerationist roots, it focuses its attention on the use of technology as a 
transformational mechanism of universals, such as the overcoming of gender, classes and 
races. For these reasons, xenofeminism adopts the transhumanist thesis, specifically the 
biohacking and DIY variant to establish that a transformation of technology for self-help 
purposes is possible, in this it points to female emancipation and, later, to the transformation 
of the body as a path to overcome of gender and female corporeity (Hester, 2018). The 
development of DIY biotechnologies is essential to achieve this. These objectives go back to 
the search for reproductive sovereignty that began with Del Em technology, in terms of 
menstrual extractions and, more recently, in the bio-hack-activism of xenofeminist 
gynecology laboratories in which women are trained in the manufacture of devices for the 
self-inspection of the cervix and vaginal fluid diagnosis. (Valero & Lage, 2019) 
Although it does not define itself as transhumanist, xenofeminism not only includes 
the thesis of modification of the human body, but it is compatible with Max More���s changing 
and dynamic utopia and Pierce���s morphological freedom principle , with the exception that it 
is limited to female biology .(Pilsch, 2017) 
The Transhumanisms (Results and Discussion) 
Transhumanism proposes the use of advanced technologies in the human organism to 
improve its functionality. What is understood as ���better��� will be established by the ethical 
system to which the group that proposes human enhancement goals is attached. This can be 
so flexible that it varies between utilitarian ethics (Cyborgism), Secular Humanist ethics 
(Humanity Plus, Techno-Progressivism), some pre-modern ethical systems 
(Archeofutourism), heroic or Nietzschean ethics (Suprahumanism), Hacker ethics (Body 
Hacking / Grinder), religious ethics (Transfigurism, Supermuslim) or ethical individualism 
(Extropianism).

��� Immortality��� ���on��� ���Earth?��� ���Transhumanism��� ���through��� ���Islamic��� ���Lenses 
Author������ ������Biography 
Tamim Mobayed holds a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Psychology, from Queen���s 
University Belfast, and is currently an M.A. candidate in Islamic Thought and 
Applied Ethics at Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Qatar, as well as an M.Phil.

Introduction 
In 1965, an American scientist by the name of Gordon Moore made a relatively 
specific prediction about the number of transistors within a dense integrated circuit 
that would go on to become an accurate projection of technological change as a 
whole. Moore predicted that the number of transistors within such circuits would 
double approximately every year. This prediction of exponential growth turned 
1 
out to be descriptive of much more than mere transistor populations within circuits. 
Scientific discovery and consequent developments in technology are now widely 
accepted��� ���as��� ���growing��� ���exponentially,��� ���exhibiting��� ���acceleration. 
This growth has brought with it a pushing of boundaries at an unprecedented 
speed. Writer and futurist Arthur C. Clarke (d. 2008) famously commented that, 
���Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.��� Indeed, 
2 
we appear to be on the verge of witnessing nanotechnological interventions that 
would have mere decades ago been the stuff of science fiction. Transhumanism is a 
term coined by British biologist Julian Huxley (d. 1975), brother of renowned 
3 
novelist and philosopher Aldous Huxley (d. 1963), that now refers to the process of 
improving the quality and length of human life by way of biotechnological 
interventionsincluding,butnotlimitedto,nanotechnology,cybernetics, 
pharmacological and gene therapies. While transhumanists herald this as the 
beginning of perhaps the greatest chapter in human history, those opposed to 
transhumanism��� ���are��� ���warning��� ���that��� ���all��� ���that��� ���proverbially��� ���glitters��� ���is��� ���not��� ���necessarily��� ���gold. 
Some scholars, both Islamic and non-Islamic, have suggested that the propagation 
of transhumanism presents one of the greatest challenges to humanity brought 
about by modernity. To use human discovery to alter humankind, at as 
fundamental a level as proposed by transhumanism, provokes numerous profound 
questions related to theology, philosophy, biology, psychology, and of course, 
ethics. What is interesting, and might be seen as setting the tone for this discussion,

is one of the key points taken from the story of Adam in the Qur'an. He is misled 
by the devil, in part by the promise that eating from the forbidden tree will grant 
him immortality (Qur'an 7:20); immortality is very much a part of the 
transhumanist agenda. This paper attempts to grapple with some of the most 
significant issues raised by transhumanism that will need to be addressed by 
Muslims. The main question is: what are the challenges inherent in attempting to 
reconcile��� ���Islam��� ���with��� ���transhumanism?
ChatGPT
The article titled "Immortality on Earth? Transhumanism through Islamic Lenses" by Tamim Mobayed dives into the intersection of transhumanism and Islamic theology. Let's connect this article with the previous topics and the "Transhumanisms: A Review of Transhumanist Schools of Thought" by Piero Gayozzo:
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Consciousness
:
Islamic theology emphasizes the uniqueness of human consciousness and soul. If AI is developed to a level where it might have consciousness, this could create theological debates in Islam about the nature of this consciousness and how it compares to human consciousness.
Supermuslim, a concept from Gayozzo's article, can serve as a backdrop to discuss how Islam views these technological advancements, including conscious AI.
Gene Editing and CRISPR
:
As mentioned in Mobayed's article, transhumanism's potential to alter humanity at a fundamental level would undoubtedly provoke questions in Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) about the permissibility of such interventions.
This topic could be linked to the Suprahumanism from Gayozzo's article, which emphasizes genetic engineering. The reconciliation between Islamic ethics and such technologies becomes paramount.
Religion and Spirituality
:
The emphasis on the story of Adam in the Qur'an and the lure of immortality highlights the spiritual implications of transhumanist pursuits.
Supermuslim and Transfigurist approaches in Gayozzo's article shed light on how religious beliefs can be integrated or contrasted with transhumanist ideas.
Ethics of Emerging Technologies
:
Mobayed's article underscores the ethical, theological, philosophical, and biological dilemmas introduced by transhumanism, especially from an Islamic perspective.
This connects with the broader ethical questions discussed in Gayozzo's article across various transhumanist schools of thought.
Biohacking
:
The interventions discussed in Mobayed's article, like nanotechnology and gene therapies, can be seen as advanced forms of biohacking. The permissibility and ethical considerations of these in Islamic thought can be explored.
Xenofeminism's emphasis on body transformation can serve as another angle to discuss how religions, including Islam, view body autonomy and modification.
Neuralink
:
Just as Neuralink aims to augment human capabilities, the transhumanist technologies discussed in Mobayed's article, like cybernetics, aim to enhance human potential. Islamic views on such enhancements and the balance between human effort (ikhtiar) and divine will (qadr) could be a fascinating area of discussion.
In essence, the crux of both articles revolves around the ethical, spiritual, and practical implications of human enhancement technologies. While Gayozzo's piece offers a spectrum of transhumanist philosophies, Mobayed's article delves deeper into how one of the world's major religions, Islam, might grapple with these advancements. Drawing these connections facilitates an understanding of how traditional belief systems can navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of human potential and technology.
What about connections to our earlier discussion on the Bible as an Iconoclastic Guide?
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's connect the article "Immortality on Earth? Transhumanism through Islamic Lenses" with our earlier discussion on the Bible as an Iconoclastic Guide:
Human Hubris
:
The biblical narrative often warns against human pride and arrogance, such as the Tower of Babel story where humanity tried to build a tower to heaven.
Transhumanism, especially when it touches upon achieving immortality on Earth, might be seen from a biblical lens as another example of human hubris. Just as the devil tempted Adam in the Qur'an with the promise of immortality, the Bible contains several instances where the lure of going beyond God's set boundaries resulted in downfall.
Divine Image
:
The Bible states that humans are made in the image of God. The push for transhumanism could be seen as a challenge to this divine image, altering what God has set in place.
This could lead to questions about the sanctity and dignity of human life. If humans modify themselves extensively, are they still in the "image of God"?
Morality and Ethics
:
The Bible, being an iconoclastic guide, often challenges prevailing moral norms and calls for a higher ethical standard.
Transhumanism raises profound ethical dilemmas, especially in terms of who gets access to these technologies and the potential societal divisions they could create. From a biblical perspective, there would be concerns about justice, equity, and the potential for idolizing technology.
Nature of Immortality
:
The Bible discusses the concept of eternal life, particularly in the New Testament, as something spiritual and granted by God through faith.
The transhumanist goal of earthly immortality could be contrasted with the biblical view of eternal life, leading to a rich theological debate on the nature and desirability of both forms of immortality.
Role of Temptation
:
As with the Qur'an's narrative of Adam being tempted by the devil with the promise of immortality, the Bible also contains the story of the serpent tempting Eve with the forbidden fruit, offering knowledge and the possibility of being "like God."
The allure of transhumanism, with its promise of enhanced life and abilities, can be paralleled with such biblical temptations, prompting discussions on the potential consequences of yielding to such temptations.
Stewardship
:
The Bible teaches that humans are stewards of creation. This responsibility can be brought into the discussion on how humans approach advancements like transhumanism. Is it responsible stewardship to push the boundaries of human potential, or is it overstepping divine boundaries?
In essence, while the article by Tamim Mobayed examines transhumanism through Islamic lenses, the Bible, with its iconoclastic approach, offers another rich and complex lens to scrutinize and understand the implications of human enhancement technologies. Both religious texts highlight the challenges, temptations, and ethical quandaries posed by the intersection of faith and technology.
I thought the whisperer's assertion to test the hypothesis about really dying might be an early example of the scientific method. The tree if the science of what is pleasing and what is broken (good and evil).  Whisperer is a pun, it doesn't literally mean snake but hisser, which also meanr soothsayer or enchanted. The word sounds similar in Arabic the word hiya (a snake, a living thing, curl around).  I think that the tetragrammaton YHWH might mean ya Hawwah with a shaddah over the w and meaning o living one, or o mother of the living. (O Eve) or else it is yahaweh meaning something like He Lives or They Live.  The other tree is called Eve's tree, the Living tree, or the Tree of Life.
ChatGPT
You're diving deep into the etymological and theological layers of these texts, which is always a fascinating exercise. Let's unpack your insights:
Scientific Method
:
The whisperer's challenge to test the hypothesis of death could indeed be seen as an early representation of empirical inquiry. It's a call to question authority (in this case, God's command) through experience.
Tree of Knowledge
:
Your interpretation of the tree as representing the "science of what is pleasing and what is broken (good and evil)" is a compelling way to understand the balance and dichotomy of knowledge. This tree grants discernment and the capacity to judge.
Whisperer vs. Snake
:
The Hebrew word for the serpent in Genesis is "������" (nachash), which can mean serpent, but as you pointed out, its root has connotations related to divination or enchantment. This aligns with the serpent's role as a tempter or revealer of hidden truths.
The linguistic connections you've drawn with Arabic are interesting. Semitic languages like Hebrew and Arabic share many etymological roots and phonetic similarities.
Tetragrammaton YHWH
:
YHWH is traditionally understood as the ineffable name of God in Judaism. Your interpretation of "ya Hawwah" (O Eve) offers a unique perspective, tying it to the matriarch of humanity.
Another interpretation of YHWH is "I am that I am," or "I will be who I will be," pointing to God's eternal and self-sustaining nature.
Tree of Life
:
The Tree of Life (���� ����������, Etz HaChayim) in the Garden of Eden symbolizes eternal life. Linking it to Eve, the mother of all living, creates a profound connection between the source of life and its sustenance.
Your insights reflect a deep engagement with the texts and an intertextual approach, drawing connections across languages and traditions. Such readings enrich our understanding of these ancient narratives, revealing layers of meaning that speak to both ancient and contemporary concerns.
I guess I was trying to point out that the tree of life was a transhumanist theme common to both the Qur'an and the Bible.
ChatGPT
Ah, I see. Let's delve deeper into that connection:
Transhumanism, at its core, is the idea that humans can overcome their biological limitations, often through technological and scientific means. One of the greatest limitations, arguably the final frontier, is death. The quest for immortality, or at least radically extended life spans, is a fundamental aspect of the transhumanist agenda.
In the religious narratives:
Bible
:
The Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden represents a source of eternal life. After Adam and Eve eat from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, they are banished from the Garden to prevent them from eating from the Tree of Life and living forever (Genesis 3:22).
Qur'an
:
The story of Adam and Eve also features the devil's promise of a tree that would grant them eternal life (Qur'an 7:20). As in the Bible, the allure of the tree is not merely the knowledge it offers, but the potential for immortality.
These narratives indeed present early prototypes of the transhumanist ambition. They portray a deep-rooted human desire to transcend the boundaries of mortality. Yet, in both stories, this ambition is cautioned against. The pursuit of knowledge and the desire for immortality without divine sanction leads to expulsion or fall from grace.
In the context of the modern transhumanist movement, it's interesting to consider these religious tales as cautionary stories. They warn of the perils of seeking god-like powers without wisdom, responsibility, or divine mandate. Yet, they also underscore the perennial human aspiration to transcend our natural limits.
Thus, religious scholars, like Tamim Mobayed in his exploration of transhumanism through Islamic lenses, grapple with these ancient themes in light of modern advancements. The challenge is to reconcile deep-rooted religious teachings with the rapidly evolving landscape of scientific and technological progress.
I also thought the story about Moses staff eating up the other staffs might be a metaphor for cultural assimilation, linguistic development of international languages from pigins, Creoles, and prestige languages (socioeconomic trendsetters) and how ideologies can encompass each other.
ChatGPT
That's a fascinating interpretation! The story of Moses' staff turning into a serpent that consumes the staffs of the Pharaoh's magicians is found in both the Bible (Exodus 7:8-12) and the Qur'an (Surah Taha 20:66-69). Traditionally, this miracle is seen as a demonstration of God's power over human magic or craftsmanship, showing that divine authority is supreme.
Let's unpack your interpretation:
Cultural Assimilation
: Just as Moses' serpent devoured the serpents of the magicians, dominant cultures often absorb elements from minority cultures. Over time, the minority culture's distinct traits can become subsumed, almost as if "eaten up", by the larger culture.
Linguistic Development
: Pidgin languages arise as a means of communication between groups that do not have a language in common. Over generations, these can develop into Creoles with their own native speakers. Dominant or prestige languages can influence or "consume" aspects of these Pidgin languages and Creoles, much like Moses' serpent consumed the other serpents.
Ideological Encompassment
: Dominant ideologies often integrate aspects of minor ones, effectively subsuming them. Over time, the distinct traits of the minor ideology can be overshadowed or fully integrated into the dominant one.
While it's uncertain if the ancient writers intended for such a metaphorical interpretation, one of the beauties of religious and philosophical texts is their capacity to resonate with readers in various ways throughout time. Connecting the story to linguistic and cultural processes provides a contemporary lens through which to understand age-old tales, showing their continued relevance and adaptability.
