\title{Mem\textbar8: A Working Substrate for Xylomorphic Computation}
\author{}

\maketitle

\section*{Abstract}
This is written as a continuation, not a critique. The xylomorphic frame identifies the right gaps---Mem\textbar8 demonstrates how they are solved in practice.

\section{Rebuttal Summary}
... (same sections as before) ...

\section*{Closing}
The xylomorphic vision calls for systems that honor time, resonance, and form. Mem\textbar8 delivers them as running code: temporal grain, interference-based storage, reflex layers, custodial ethics, and integrated tooling.

For further extension, see the \textit{Ayian Feasibility Study} and the \textit{Petabyte Covenant}, which describe how MEM\textbar8 extends resonance into economic and social domains.
