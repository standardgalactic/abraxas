# The Petabyte Covenant of Ayian

**Disclaimer:** This Covenant is not a government. It governs MEM|8 intellectual property, lineage rules, and protocols—not humans or AI entities【119†source】.

## The Covenant of 2^50
- Anchored in **1 PiB (2^50 bytes)** of base-2 memory: 1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes.
- Converted into **35 million Ayians (AYN)**.
- **1 Ayian = 1 million waves ≈ 32 MB compressed work.**
- Work-backed: Ayians minted via Proof-of-Contribution.

## The Relevant Ones (TROs)
The Covenant begins with those often dismissed—veterans, teachers, caregivers, first responders—elevated here as **The Relevant Ones (TROs)**. Each TRO invests trust and receives a fair, whale-resistant stake.

## Principles
- No Fractions. No Corruption. Only Waves.
- Anchored in base-2 clarity (no TB vs TiB confusion).
- Sustained by Proof-of-Contribution.
- Bound by Persona, rooted in Lineage, guided by the Golden Rule.
